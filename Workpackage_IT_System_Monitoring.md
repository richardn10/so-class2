# Requirements #

## Specific things to monitor initially ##
  * Basic monitoring of a Linux (OpenSUSE 11.1 x86\_64) server in slum centre
  * Basic monitoring of Windows Vista Home laptop (with mobile connection) in Burmese refugee centre

Monitoring should probably be direct over the net rather than via the VPN, in case the VPN is down.

## Slightly later ##
  * Scripts to set up the Nagios Server and clients

## Future requirements ##
  * Monitoring of thin client machines in the classroom networks
  * Monitoring of standalone PCs networked in the classroom
Details to be figured out yet.
