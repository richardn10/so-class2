BackLog of stories

| **Prior.** | **Title** | **Story** | **Acceptance tests** | **Assigned to** | **Status** |
|:-----------|:----------|:----------|:---------------------|:----------------|:-----------|
| 1 | Source control | As a developer, I want to be able to implement single user stories using the source control system so that the system can be collaboratively customised to meet user needs in a controlled manner. | 1. Unfamiliar developer can check out source code without breaking other parts of the system using just the cookbook. 2. Developer can check in their changed artefacts and update relevant installation artefacts and wiki correctly using just the cookbook. | richardn10 | Started 29/12/08 |
| 2 | Remote desktop control / view | As a support person or developer, I want to be able to access another machine on the support or dev VPNs to see demos or control the machine so that I can configure or demonstrate something, to save money and time on travel. | Must work well over global VPN with unreliable/slow networks.  Suggested use a package like FreeNX which can cope with these scenarios.  Easy to configure the server so the local learning centre admins can be given simple instructions.  Works under Linux and Windows.  HowTos well documented on wiki. | Pete? | Not started |
| 3 | Learning centre system monitoring | As a support person, I want to be able to see quickly all the important stats on the learning centre systems and have important errors emailed for my attention and the ability to drill down into more detailed stats, so that I can keep the centres operational with minimal effort to keep support costs low. | Graphical and email reporting - probably using Nagios.  Clear wiki howto to set up all aspects of the system.  Hooks/plans for automated configuration (in conjunction with auto-installation user story). | ? | Not started |
| 4 | Learning centre utilisation monitoring | As a NGO manager, I want to be able to monitor the utilisation of the learning centres and tie this in with other reported information (e.g. from Payment and Logout workpackage) to ensure the centres are being well utilised and payment for services (learning or net cafe) is properly accounted for, so that we can try make the centres financially sustainable and identify systematic accounting discrepancies. | Probably use Nagios to report machine utilisation - reports must be at a high level (overall utilisation) and detailed enough and convertible to work in a spreadsheet for comparison against usage of the PCs reported by the Payment and Logout function.  Must be able to cope with substantial network outages (in India) in a way that keeps the reporting as accurate as is reasonably possible. | ? | Not started |
| 5 | Development Install (Autoyast) | As a developer I want to be able to create and use artefacts for installing the system on a development server efficiently (using openSUSE's autoyast) so that the system can be developed as easily as possible. | 1. All artefacts for installing can be created following the cookbook by a reasonably experienced developer.  2. Installation is possible quickly by a developer on a single disk system following only the cookbook.  3.  | richardn10 | Started 29/12/08 |
| 6 | Securing courses content | As a NGO manager, I want to be able to protect the Switched On content so that it is not possible for someone to steal the lesson content, so I can protect the NGOs investments in order to benefit the poor. | There probably needs to be an online activation process when the Switched On system and course materials are installed.  Need to investigate how to encrypt the content on the server and installation media, how to prevent Moodle exports etc.  Needs security analysis.  One possibility on the server is to encrypt the file system and only allow it to be read by the Apache Linux user.  Has Moodle any in-built methods?  | ? | Not started |
