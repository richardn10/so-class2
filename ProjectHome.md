# Open Source Computer Training Centre System #
## Sharing what we have learned ##

This project successfully:
  * Developed an open source computer training centre in a box using thin client and remote management.  It was used in a computer training centre in India for three years, built on a few key open source projects including [LTSP](http://www.ltsp.org) and [OpenVPN](http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/overview.html).
  * Supported the trial of blended language learning trials in rural India, using [Moodle](http://www.moodle.org) and media production.
  * Made significant progress with development of a "classroom" management system enabling nominally chargeable services towards a social enterprise model e.g. charging for lessons and net cafe.

Resources to share what we learned:
  * [Technical Overview of the Switched On system.](http://switchedon.org/Technical.asp)
  * [Project Wiki](Home.md)
  * Discussions take place on our [Google discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/so-class2).

You may contact us if you are running a similar project and would be interested in learning from our experiences and code.
