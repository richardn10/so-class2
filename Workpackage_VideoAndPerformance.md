  * Technique add in corrections to the videos later on:
  * if realise at end of class, Merja present to a few students while she and hair look same
  * could just put up a slide â€“ e.g. of dictionary definition (e.g. of humid)
  * could at end of following lesson just record her voice and that of students in CCQs and have slide as visual (cos they will look different)
