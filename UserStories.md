BackLog of stories

| **Prior.** | **Title** | **Story** | **Acceptance tests** | **Assigned to** | **Status** |
|:-----------|:----------|:----------|:---------------------|:----------------|:-----------|
| 1 | Source control | As a developer, I want to be able to implement single user stories using the source control system so that the system can be collaboratively customised to meet user needs in a controlled manner. | 1. Unfamiliar developer can check out source code without breaking other parts of the system using just the cookbook. 2. Developer can check in their changed artefacts and update relevant installation artefacts and wiki correctly using just the cookbook. | richardn10 | Started 29/12/08 |
| 2 | Remote desktop control / view | As a support person or developer, I want to be able to access another machine on the support or dev VPNs to see demos or control the machine so that I can configure or demonstrate something, to save money and time on travel. | Must work well over global VPN with unreliable/slow networks.  Suggested use a package like FreeNX which can cope with these scenarios.  Easy to configure the server so the local learning centre admins can be given simple instructions.  Works under Linux and Windows.  HowTos well documented on wiki. | Pete? | Not started |
| 3 | Learning centre system monitoring | As a support person, I want to be able to see quickly all the important stats on the learning centre systems and have important errors emailed for my attention and the ability to drill down into more detailed stats, so that I can keep the centres operational with minimal effort to keep support costs low. | Graphical and email reporting - probably using Nagios.  Clear wiki howto to set up all aspects of the system.  Hooks/plans for automated configuration (in conjunction with auto-installation user story). | ? | Not started |
| 4 | Development Install (Autoyast) | As a developer I want to be able to create and use artefacts for installing the system on a development server efficiently (using openSUSE's autoyast) so that the system can be developed as easily as possible. | 1. All artefacts for installing can be created following the cookbook by a reasonably experienced developer.  2. Installation is possible quickly by a developer on a single disk system following only the cookbook.  3.  | richardn10 | Started 29/12/08 |
