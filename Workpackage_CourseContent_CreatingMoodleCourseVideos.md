Tim needs to blog on these topics (not yet done) in no particualr order
  * issues when filming
  * issues converting classroom course into segmented blocks that can be moodled
  * use of premiere
  * exporting power point slides
  * inventing course nomenclature and carefulyl tracking it in file names
  * Using Camstudio to record screen manouvres
  * types of content that we videoed (not all just pieces to camera)
  * issues about renderding camstudio avi file in premiere - used after effects
  * Exporting settings in sorenson squeeze
  * two camera filming
  * miking the lecturer for good sound
  * able to film in non linear format and re order in edit - example of video 2a

Also on moodle
  * concept of how videos are sequenced in the Lesson content type in moodle along with other kinds of content
  * Teachers made pencilled notes as they worked on the presentation for camera prior to actually filming it. Not sure this has been wiki'd
  * Scripting the SWF component in Moodle so that you can force the playing of a video from start to finish without skipping bits on first play
  * concept of every video have a predictable filename based on identifiers from the MySQL rather than hard coded filenames stored in moodle lesson entries
