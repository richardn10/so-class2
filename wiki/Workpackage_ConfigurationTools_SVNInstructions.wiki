#summary Instructions on installing SVN or TortoiseSVN and using the SO repository.

= Introduction =

To keep all our files safe and in an organised structure, you will need to install SVN (Linux) or TortoiseSVN (Windows) on your computer.  For the MAC users amongst us... please edit this and tell us how you did it :-) I might get some time later in the weekend - sorry.

=== Installing TortoiseSVN (Windows) ===

  * Install TortoiseSVN (if you have an existing version of TortoiseSVN, uninstall it and restart your computer before upgrading or there may be problems)

Go to this link for the download [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads]
   - for 32 bit computers use the link TortoiseSVN-1.6.0.15855-win32-svn-1.6.0.msi

=== Checking out (getting) the Switched On files ===

  * Create a new folder anywhere on your computer (perhaps in Documents).
    * Call the new Folder "Switched On" (this actually can be whatever you like).
  * Right click on your new folder and a menu will come up
    * click the SVN Checkout... menu item
      * In the "URL of repository" box, type:
{{{https://so-class2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/}}}

			(if you want you can replace trunk/ with a branch or tag version you want to use)

        * You can either select "HEAD revision" to get the latest version with all changes, or
      * You can enter a revision number to get a particular revision (click "Show Log" to see the revisions)
      * Click OK
