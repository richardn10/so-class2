= Scenario =

The setting is a computer training centre in Kotwali village, Malda, West Bengal, India.

Eight students are filing into the centre for a lesson in basic office application skills, led by a virtual teacher and a real facilitator.

At the reception desk, they each pay for the lesson, with the facilitator being notified of the charge for each on the reception computer as he selects the students' names.  The students pay on a lesson-by-lesson basis because this matches their families' cash-flow better than paying up-front.  The facilitator takes 10Rs from seven, but 5Rs from one for whom a concession has been agreed in advance.  If a student pays a different amount (less due to financial difficulty or more to compensate for shortfalls) then the teacher must record this.  The computer records each transaction irrevocably, as a disincentive against corruption.  The facilitator actually has to add one of the students into the centre's Switched On computer database because she is new.  She also needs to be entered into the classroom management system, which uses a software package called Moodle (see www.moodle.org).

The seven existing students are already assigned to groups in a database running on a server in the computer centre.  The facilitator directs each group to its own computer (or terminal).  For practical reasons, these three computers are located within a single cubicle so the students can all hear the virtual teacher and each other, but are not too disturbed by other students (or vice-versa).  The facilitator assigns the new student to an existing group of two, such that there are now two groups of three and one pair.

The facilitator assigns one of the groups to be the lesson controller.  When the "controller" group plays the virtual teacher video clips on its computer, the video clips play in synchronicity on the other two computers (but on no other computer).  This means the groups all watch the virtual teacher together and can all "participate" in unison with the virtual class.  In-between clips from the virtual classroom, the groups work at their own pace on the computer-based exercises.  Alternatively, they may undertake peer-group activities such as discussions or exercises with physical materials provided by the facilitator.  The facilitator will guide the activities and playing of the classroom videos, taking queues from their course facilitator handbook and the particular needs of the students.  For example, the facilitator may start the first few lesson clips and then hand over to the controller group once it gets the hang of it, help the students as they attempt to format an Office document, and provide feedback to the whole group at the end of certain exercises.

Before the lesson starts, the students one-by-one register at their terminal by entering each his or her name and typing a private password.  Each is asked by the computer to confirm the number of Rupees they paid for this lesson as entered by the facilitator into the Switched On database, and to correct it if necessary.  Note that this is not the same as the students logging in.  The group logs in to Moodle by entering a group username and password.  The computer's ID, group ID, student IDs, course and lesson number are all recorded and associated in the Switched On database.  These data can be viewed via a Web page by the facilitator and other trainers or assessors.  Students will be encouraged to register at each lesson by a minumum lesson attendance criteria for passing the course.
