TODO... Richard did it!

= Post-install system config =

These are changes that don't need to be in source control (subversion), since they are system configuration items - even though they require changes to some files.

# Allow symbolic links.<br />
# (By default these aren't allowed from a system security perspective... however moodle uses symbolic links for e.g. images.)<br />
#<br />
vi /etc/apache2/conf.d/moodle_include.conf
  within '<Directory /srv/www/moodle>'
  modify
    'Options None'
  to be
    'Options FollowSymLinks'

# Allow apache to write to the moodle and moodledata directories.<br />
# (Apache runs as root, but its client threads run as wwwrun.)<br />
# Specifically the moodledata/sessions/ directory - otherwise moodle authenticates you, but doesn't remember you as being logged in.<br />
# Also allow the users group to write files in the directory.<br />
#<br />
  chown -R wwwrun:users /srv/www/moodle
  chown -R wwwrun:users /srv/www/moodledata
#<br />
  chmod -R 775 /srv/www/moodle
  chmod -R 775 /srv/www/moodledata

# Since the local network (whilst in Cambridge at least) doesn't have a DNS server, don't have moodle re-write the URL to use the domain name of the server.<br />
# Just use the IP instead.<br />
#<br />
vi /srv/www/moodle/config.php
  Modify the '$CFG->wwwroot' value to be
    'http://192.168.0.50/moodle'
  Instead of the e.g. default
    'http://linux-wmf0/moodle'
