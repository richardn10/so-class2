|| # || Source control || As a developer, I want to be able to implement single user stories using the source control system so that the system can be collaboratively customised to meet user needs in a controlled manner. || 1. Unfamiliar developer can check out source code without breaking other parts of the system using just the cookbook. 2. Developer can check in their changed artefacts and update relevant installation artefacts and wiki correctly using just the cookbook. || richardn10 || Started 29/12/08 ||
|| # || Development Install (Autoyast) || As a developer I want to be able to create and use artefacts for installing the system on a development server efficiently (using openSUSE's autoyast) so that the system can be developed as easily as possible. || 1. All artefacts for installing can be created following the cookbook by a reasonably experienced developer.  2. Installation is possible quickly by a developer on a single disk system following only the cookbook.  3.  || richardn10 || Started 29/12/08 ||
