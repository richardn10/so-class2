#summary VPN Client installation for Linux

= VPN Client installation on Linux =

  * Open a terminal window
  * Use the package manager to install openvpn
{{{
sudo yast2 -i openvpn # for OpenSuse
sudo apt-get install openvpn #for Debian/Ubuntu
yum install openvpn #for Fedora/RedHat/CentOS
}}}

  * Copy the certificate manager to your home folder (for example)
{{{
cp -r /usr/share/openvpn/easy-rsa/2.0 ~/certificate_manager # for OpenSuse
cp -r /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/easy-rsa/2.0 ~/certificate_manager # for Debian/Ubuntu
cp -r /usr/share/doc/packages/openvpn/easy-rsa/2.0 ~/certificate_manager #for Fedora/RedHat/CentOS
}}}

  * Go to the certificate_manager directory and download some configuration files
{{{
cd ~/certificate_manager
wget
wget
wget
}}}

  * Generate a key request. Give as name the name you got from the SwitchedOn admin
{{{
. ./vars
./build-req
}}}

  * Send the file "keys/[yourname].req" to the switchedon admin. DO NOT SHARE THE .key FILE!

  * The admin sends back a [yourname].crt file. Place this in the keys folder.
  * The admin sends also a [yourname].conf file. Place this file in your home directory. If you putted your certificates in a different folder, change this file accordingly
  * Start the openvpn client (in your home folder)
{{{
sudo openvpn [yourname].conf
}}}

  * Test the connection (for example with ping)
{{{
ping 10.20.0.1
}}}
