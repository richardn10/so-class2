#summary Instructions for inserting a new project into the repository.

= Introduction =

If you've been working on a new project, or a new section of a project, you will eventually want to insert it into the repository so that it can be shared with everyone and you can keep track of versions.

= Details =

== Inserting a new project with SVN on Linux ==

*INCORRECT*
  * Log into [http://code.google.com/p/so-class2/source/checkout] and copy the top of the two examples _the one that has {{{https://}}} not {{{http://}}}_ (if there's only one example, you've not yet logged in).

  * If you're asked for your password, click "googlecode.com password" on the googlecode page to get your Google Code password)

This will create a directory under your current directory called so-class2 with all the files in it.




== Inserting a new project with TortoiseSVN on Windows ==

  * Go to the folder where your main project folder is.  (eg. If your main project is a folder called {{{lessons}}} and this is in your {{{Documents}}} folder, go to the {{{Documents}}} folder).
  * Right click on the folder ({{{lessons}}} in this example) and a menu will come up
    * click the {{{TortoiseSVN}}} menu item
    * click the {{{Import...}}} menu item
      In the "URL of repository" box, type:
      {{{https://so-class2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/project/}}}
      Replace the word {{{project}}} with a name for your project.  Don't forget to have a / on the end!
    * Type in a message descriing the project you are inserting
    * Click OK

  * If prompted for your username and password, enter the details you find here (you'll need to log in to google for this):
