#Basic setup of OpenSUSE

= Development Server =
See [http://www.opensuse.org  www.opensuse.org] for instructions, though it's fairly straightforward if you work through the installation wizard.

= Production Server =
The disks need to be set up carefully with a software RAID configuration suggested as follows:

|| *Disk 1 * ||  || *Disk 2 * ||
|| Boot || 100MB? Petri? || Not used ||

100MB should be enough for boot partition

|| / (root)  || 10G - Petri, can this be RAID? || / (root) ||

Yes - Can and should be.

|| /exp home,tmp,var,local,srv  || Petri - OK to use symbolic links for these? 390G || /exp var home,tmp,var,local,srv ||

What you mean by symbolic links here? You mean creating one filesystem like /ext and
then creating symbolic link from /home to /ext/home?

|| *Disk 3 * ||  || *Disk 4 * ||
|| /store (for VMs & backups) || 100G || /store ||
|| /course || encrypted 300G || /course ||

Could the most straightforward solution be to use LVM on top of the RAID-devices?

You could create 2 different raid-devices.
md0 for '/'
md1 for everything else

Something similar to example in http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO-11.html

LVM would make the administration more flexible in the future.

By-the-way what RAID level you are planning to use? Raid 1 for mirroring or RAID-0 for
striping?

But in general your setup sounds OK.
