= This page is Work in Progress and may change significantly =

= Development server requirements =
  * Server with at least 6GB HD & 512 MB RAM. [http://www.vmware.com/products/server/ VMWare Server] recommended
  * Fast internet connection from the server (for downloads).  Most efficient if has DHCP server to auto-assign IP connection details
  * OpenSUSE 11.1 DVD - from [http://software.opensuse.org/]

= Installing the server software =
  # InitialOpenSuseSetup - partition and standard install with Gnome desktop:
    * Use standard OpenSUSE 11.1 DVD (above)
    * AutoInstall
  # ModifyInstalledPackages
    * via broadband network connection
    * via AdditionalInstallDvd (where network poor)
  # Apply ConfigChanges and install Switched On special files

= Installing the thin client software =
This is only necessary if your Client PC network card/BIOS are not PXE boot-capable.
  * InstallThinClientSoftware

= Creating Installation Artefacts =
These are the files necessary to complete the above steps to install the server and client.  These procedures are only necessary if you are a developer/tester and need to perform an installation incorporating system changes.
  # CreatePackageModificationScript
  # CreateAdditionalInstallDvd
  # CreateConfigChangesArchive
  # CreateAutoInstallDvd
  # CreateClientInstallMedia

= Checking software in/out =
The following are stored in the Google Code repository:
  # ConfigFiles - includes system/application config and any Switched On files not included in packages (i.e. packages installed in phases 1 and 2 of "Installing the server software")
  # DevelopmentTools - for managing the development, installation and upgrade processes.
