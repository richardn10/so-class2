= Development Tasks =
So what are the types of challenge we will face?

 # Educationalists (Teachers):  Develop a methodology and sample course outline and sample lesson using the popular open source Moodle classroom management system.
 # Web developers and designers:  Enhance the Moodle user interface and create a "Switched On tools" interface to make the educational experience a joy for students and teachers alike.  An easy-to-use interface will be key to the success of the whole project as the students are not educated in computer use.
 # Linux-ers: Develop scripts to automate various installation, configuration and backup processes
 # Systems folks: Invent system for recovery of dual-boot desktop PC Windows and Linux from a backup partition.
 # Linux-ers (Tom): Setup of performance and usage monitoring tools (sadly this may need to include Microsoft PCs too)
 # Linux-ers:  Try make broadcast of video in LTSP environment efficient (Linux Terminal Server Project).
 # Create a script to convert all close questions in certain courses (specified in a help file) case-sensitive.  This is necessary for teaching English.  See http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=36430&parent=170308  (comment made on Friday, 30 December 2005, 02:49 AM)
 # There are plenty of other areas that need tackling, so let me know your skills if you can make it, and I'll try fit people to tasks in small teams with the necessary complementary skills.


= Dual-licensing strategy =
We intend to operate a dual-licence policy that is common with commercial open source software (E.g. http://www.funambol.com/solutions/licensing.php).  You will be asked to sign a declaration such that any artefacts you create will come under an open source licence, but will also be usable by a business for commercial purposes outside the open souce agreement.  This is to enable us to set up a business with a social consience in India with the aim of propagating training centres to further disadvantaged people by making the enterprise financially self-sustaining.  We will only be able to maintain this initiative if we can operate competitively, which means not giving away all the artefacts that will evolve from our joint work, and enhanced by the business at considerable cost.  We hope you understand the necessity for this.  Enterprise, charities and government will increasingly need to share with each other to meet the needs of the developing world.

Because the artefacts you help create will be under an open source agreement, anything you create will be available to the public to use and enhance at no cost under the same licensing terms.
