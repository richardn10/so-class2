In summary, this makes both you and Switched On (International) joint owners of your contribution so we can both use it as we see fit without any obligation to each other.  This could allow Switched On to use your code commercially in the future in order to help towards being a more financially self-sustainable organisation.  Your code will not be exploited for personal benefit as Switched On is legally (and morally) obliged to operate as a non-profit organisation for public benefit.
