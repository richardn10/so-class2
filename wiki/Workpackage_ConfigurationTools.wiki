= Introduction =
The configuration of Switched On has several parts:
  # A *tool creation script* to get all resouces from HQ and create an Installation CD containing all needed pckages, configuration file and artefacts.
  This will either be run from HQ and the CDs shipped to the centres, or it can be run from the centres and will get the information from HQ over the internet (for when link speeds get fast enough).

  # An *install script* which will turn an openSUSE 11.1 machine into a _Switched On_ machine, installing all needed packages, configuration files and artefacts.
  This runs at the centres from the CD created in step 1.  It should be fully automaic (or as near to as possible).

  # The *Switched On Configuration Tool* - which runs automatically in a browser from the Installation CD once the machine has been _Switched On_.  This allows installing of Lessons, Media and (perhaps) users contained on the CD.
  The same CD as step 2, but once it has detected that the machine has been switched on, then this is run.

= Requirements =

  * Base configuration should be the same for all main servers (thin client server)
  * Must be some configurations specific to each centre, that will be applied the same each time the system is installed (i.e. at a particular centre):
    * Server name
    * Network address ranged used in the classroom
    * VPN setup - certificate installed etc
