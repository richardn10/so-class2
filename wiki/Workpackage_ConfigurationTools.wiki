#summary Create HQ CDs for distributing the system and develop the Switched On Configuration Tool for managing classroom servers.

Go back to TheChallenge.

= Introduction =
The configuration of Switched On has several parts:
  # A *tool creation script* to get all resouces from HQ and create an Installation CD containing all needed pckages, configuration file and artefacts.
  # An *install script* which will turn an openSUSE 11.1 machine into a _Switched On_ machine, installing all needed packages, configuration files and artefacts.
  # The *Switched On Configuration Tool* - which runs automatically in a browser from the Installation CD once the machine has been _Switched On_.  This allows installing of Lessons, Media and (perhaps) users contained on the CD.
