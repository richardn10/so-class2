#summary Create HQ CDs for distributing the system and develop the Switched On Configuration Tool for managing classroom servers.
#sidebar TableOfContents

Go back to [Workpackages].

= Introduction =
The configuration of Switched On has several parts:
  # A *tool creation script* to get all resouces from HQ and create an Installation CD containing all needed pckages, configuration file and artefacts.
  # An *install script* which will turn an openSUSE 11.1 machine into a _Switched On_ machine, installing all needed packages, configuration files and artefacts.
  # The *Switched On Configuration Tool* - which runs automatically in a browser from the Installation CD once the machine has been _Switched On_.  This allows installing of Lessons, Media and (perhaps) users contained on the CD.

= Requirements =

  * Base configuration should be the same for all main servers (thin client server)
  * Must be some configurations specific to each centre, that will be applied the same each time the system is installed (i.e. at a particular centre):
    * Server name
    * Network address ranged used in the classroom
    * VPN setup - certificate installed etc

= Team documentation =
(Description of your product, dependencies, how to install, use, modify, outstanding issues etc.)
