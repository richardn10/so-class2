description=Core install of 1.9.3 - this is the very first initial install of SO Moodle!

moodle-core-package-url=http://download.moodle.org/stable19/moodle-1.9.3.tgz

# The filename created locally from the url, only required if the url is set.
# This must be set if moodle-core-package-url is.
moodle-core-package-file=moodle-1.9.3.tgz

# Currently, the core moodle tgz extracts everything to a 'moodle' dir.
# However we can't assume this will always be the case.
moodle-core-package-subdir=moodle

# The dir to install moodle inside e.g. /srv/www/
moodle-www-subdir=moodle

# If yes, then the files from moodle_www-so-mods are used.
# If no, then moodle_www-so-mods is not used for this patch.
# HOWEVER - if moodle-core-package-url is set, then this must be yes, since
# a core package will cause a recreate of the moodle www dir.
patch-www=yes

# The patch install script will also look for and make use of a file named
# patch_$patchId-db.sql
# Any .sql.gz files are automatically gunzip'd by the install script.
#

# This should only every be blank for the initial install (patchId=0).
# Otherwise should be "moodle" (with no quotes).
# This is used (if the db patch file exists) to backup the database, and also to apply subsequent patches against.
